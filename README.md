# Cloud-Native Infrastructure Implementation Project
## Project Overview

üîç **Primary Objective**: Implement a secure, monitored, multi-cloud Kubernetes infrastructure with database integration and application deployment.

## Phase 1: Exoscale Infrastructure Implementation
### 1.1 Kubernetes Cluster Setup
- Deploy production-grade Kubernetes cluster in Exoscale
- Implement infrastructure as code using Terraform
- Configure RBAC and security policies
- Set up cluster networking and load balancing

### 1.2 Database Integration
- Provision Exoscale DBaaS instance
- Configure database security groups and access policies
- Implement database backup and recovery procedures
- Create Kubernetes secrets for database credentials

### 1.3 Application Deployment
- Develop Kubernetes manifests for application deployment
- Implement ConfigMaps for environment-specific configurations
- Configure horizontal pod autoscaling
- Set up ingress controllers and TLS termination

### 1.4 Monitoring Implementation
- Deploy Grafana Operator
- Configure Prometheus for metrics collection
- Implement alerting rules and notification channels
- Set up logging stack (Loki) for log aggregation
- Create custom dashboards for:
  - Cluster health metrics
  - Application performance metrics
  - Database metrics
  - Cost monitoring

## Phase 2: Multi-Cloud Private Network Implementation
### 2.1 Hetzner Infrastructure
- Deploy Kubernetes cluster in Hetzner Cloud
- Configure private networking
- Implement firewall rules and security groups
- Set up VPN connectivity between clusters

### 2.2 Network Security Implementation
- Create private networks in both clouds
- Implement network policies
- Configure IPSec/WireGuard tunnels between clusters
- Set up egress/ingress filtering

### 2.3 Cross-Cluster Communication
- Implement service mesh (Istio/Linkerd)
- Configure cross-cluster service discovery
- Set up load balancing between clusters
- Implement failover mechanisms

### 2.4 Security Hardening
- Implement network segmentation
- Configure WAF for public-facing services
- Set up intrusion detection/prevention
- Implement pod security policies

## Deliverables
1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) repositories
2. CI/CD pipelines for application deployment
3. Monitoring dashboards and alerting configuration
4. Network architecture documentation
5. Security compliance documentation
6. Runbooks for common operations

## Success Criteria
- Zero-downtime application deployment
- <99.9% cluster uptime
- Complete monitoring coverage
- Secure cross-cluster communication
- Automated deployment processes
- Comprehensive documentation

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 3-4 weeks
- Phase 2: 4-5 weeks
- Total project duration: 7-9 weeks

## Technologies & Tools
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, Exoscale, Hetzner Cloud
- **Containerization**: Kubernetes, Docker
- **Monitoring**: Grafana Operator, Prometheus, Loki
- **Networking**: Calico, MetalLB, Istio/Linkerd
- **Security**: Cert-Manager, Vault, Network Policies
- **CI/CD**: ArgoCD/Flux, GitHub Actions

## Risk Mitigation
1. Regular security audits
2. Automated backup procedures
3. Disaster recovery planning
4. Performance testing before production deployment
5. Fallback procedures for critical services
